      <h2>WHITE BELT</h2>
      <p>The white belt symbolizes the beginning of the Taekwondo journey, 
        representing purity, innocence, and the concept of a blank canvas 
        upon which the student will paint their martial arts story. 
        It signifies a newcomer's humble and receptive attitude, 
        ready to absorb the knowledge and skills that lie ahead.</p>

      <h2 class="tright1" class="y">YELLOW BELT</h2>
      <p> Progressing from the white belt, 
        the yellow belt represents the initial 
        stages of growth and development in Taekwondo. 
        Yellow symbolizes the earth from which a seedling 
        sprouts and takes root. At this stage, students begin 
        to establish a foundation in basic techniques and forms, 
        laying the groundwork for their future advancement.</p>

  <div class="belts">
    <img src="blue.jpg">
    <div class="tbox">
      <h2 class="blue">BLUE BELT</h2>
      <p>Progressing into the intermediate ranks, 
        the blue belt represents the expansion of the 
        student's horizons, much like the vastness of the sky. 
        Blue symbolizes aspiration and the pursuit of higher goals. 
        As students reach this stage, they begin to explore more 
        complex techniques, deepen their understanding of 
        sparring strategies, and develop greater mental discipline and focus.</p>

  <div class="belts">
    <img class="right" src="red.jpg">
    <div class="tbox">
      <h2 class="tright2">RED BELT</h2>
      <p>Red, the color of warning and caution, 
        represents the increased responsibility and 
        potential danger that comes with advancing further in Taekwondo. 
        At this stage, students are expected to 
        demonstrate a higher level of skill, control, 
        and discipline in their practice. Red belt 
        practitioners are reminded to approach their 
        training with humility, respect, and a keen awareness 
        of their own abilities.</p>

  <div class="belts">
    <img src="brown.jpg">
    <div class="tbox">
      <h2 class="brown">BROWN BELT</h2>
      <p>The brown belt represents the stage of 
        advanced proficiency and preparation for the final 
        leap towards black belt mastery. It symbolizes the 
        ripening of the student's skills and knowledge, 
        much like a seed reaching full maturity before bearing fruit. 
        Brown signifies stability, strength, and the deepening of 
        roots in the art of Taekwondo. At this stage, 
        practitioners refine their techniques to a high degree of precision, 
        demonstrating mastery over a wide range of movements, forms, and sparring strategies. 
        They also begin to delve into the philosophical and spiritual aspects of Taekwondo, 
        exploring concepts such as integrity, perseverance, and indomitable spirit. 
        Brown belt holders are expected to exhibit exemplary leadership qualities, 
        serving as mentors and role models for lower-ranked students 
        while continuing to pursue excellence in their own training.</p>

    <div class="tbox">
      <h2 class="tright3">BLACK BELT</h2>
      <p>The black belt symbolizes mastery and proficiency in Taekwondo, 
        but it also represents the beginning of a new chapter in the practitioner's journey. 
        Achieving a black belt is not the culmination of one's 
        training but rather the initiation into a deeper level 
        of understanding and commitment to the art. Black belt 
        holders are expected to serve as role models, mentors, 
        and ambassadors of Taekwondo, continuously striving for 
        improvement and sharing their knowledge with others.</p>
