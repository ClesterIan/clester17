    <h2>TRADITIONAL DOBUK</h2>
    <p> The traditional dobok is the standard uniform worn for general 
      training and practice in Taekwondo. It encompasses the fundamental 
      elements of Taekwondo attire and is versatile for various training activities.
    </p>
    <p>Traditional doboks for both male and female practitioners 
      typically consist of a white jacket (jeogori) and white pants 
      (baji), along with a belt (ti) that signifies the practitioner's 
      rank. While some schools or organizations may have specific 
      preferences for the design of traditional doboks, the basic 
      structure remains consistent. These doboks prioritize comfort, 
      durability, and ease of movement for activities such as basic 
      techniques, forms practice, and conditioning drills. The white 
      color symbolizes purity, humility, and the beginner's mindset in Taekwondo training.

    <h2 class="tright">POOMSAE DOBUK</h2>
    <p> The poomsae dobok is tailored for practicing 
      and performing poomsae, the predetermined sequences 
      of movements in Taekwondo. It's designed to allow for 
      freedom of movement and enhance the aesthetics of the practitioner's techniques.
    </p>
    <p> The primary difference between male and female 
      poomsae doboks is often in the color of the pants. 
      Male poomsae doboks typically feature black pants, 
      while female poomsae doboks often have blue pants. 
      This variation is primarily for aesthetic purposes and to 
      distinguish between genders during competitions or demonstrations. 
      Otherwise, the design and construction of the doboks remain similar 
      for both male and female practitioners.

    <h2>SPARRING DOBUK</h2>
    <p> The sparring dobok is intended for use during 
      Taekwondo sparring matches or competitions. 
      It's designed to provide both mobility and protection 
      to the practitioner during intense combat situations.
    </p>
    <p>Sparring doboks may be differentiated by 
      color to distinguish between competitors during matches. 
      Male sparring doboks often come in blue, 
      while female sparring doboks are typically red. 
      This color contrast helps referees and judges identify 
      competitors and assign points accurately during sparring 
      competitions. The doboks themselves are crafted to be durable, 
      breathable, and provide some level of protection without restricting movement.
